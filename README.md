## Tech stack

React is used for building the UI and interactivity.
Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Things which are not implemented

There are no unit tests due to time constraints. If I were to add them, I would use Jest.
There are no e2e tests, also due to time constraints. If I were to add them, I would use Playwright or Cypress.
There is no router and code splitting because this app is small, but they are totally required in bigger apps.
No mobile layout support, just didn't have time to implement it.
