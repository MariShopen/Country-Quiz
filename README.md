- Design and requiremnets -> https://devchallenges.io/challenge/country-quizz
- Deployed version -> https://country-quiz-phi-seven.vercel.app/

## Dvelopment

1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Run `npm run dev`

## Tech stack

- React is used for building the UI and interactivity.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
- The project uses Prettier and ESLint to ensure a consistent code style and quality.
- The code is written in TypeScript to provide type safety and increase reliability.

## Things which are not implemented

- There are no unit tests due to time constraints. If I were to add them, I would use Jest.
- There are no e2e tests, also due to time constraints. If I were to add them, I would use Playwright or Cypress.
- There is no router and code splitting because this app is small, but they are totally required in bigger apps.
- No mobile layout support, just didn't have time to implement it.

## To do
- Add more question options
- Implement mobile layout
- Add user game statistics
- Integrate user saving
- Set up user authentication and the ability to share results
